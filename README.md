This is a sample data table.

The table is rendered from src/data-tables index.js
the data for the table is found in the data folder. 

Currently this just renders a simple data table. I need to expand functionality to allow for dropdowns.

Since this uses material UI the dropdown function is available to it. Esentially the idea would be to add a dropdown to the outer material ui table and then render a new react-table from the dropdown. Here is an example of the same thing working on a different project
